# User Story: Dashboard Authentication

## 📋 Basic Information
- **Story ID**: US-006
- **Title**: Implement User Authentication for Dashboard
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Epic**: EP-001 - User Management System

## 👤 User Story
**As a** trader  
**I want** to securely log into the trading dashboard  
**So that** I can access my trading data and manage my bots safely

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a user visits the dashboard login page
- [ ] **When** they enter valid credentials
- [ ] **Then** they are redirected to the main dashboard

### Additional Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] User can reset password via email
- [ ] Session persists across browser refresh
- [ ] User is logged out after 24 hours of inactivity
- [ ] Failed login attempts are logged for security
- [ ] Password requirements meet security standards

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented và tested
- [ ] Unit tests written (coverage > 80%)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed và approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Memory bank entry created
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner acceptance
- [ ] No critical bugs

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- [ ] Login component with form validation
- [ ] Registration component with password strength indicator
- [ ] Protected route wrapper component
- [ ] Authentication context provider
- [ ] Error handling for auth failures
- [ ] Loading states during auth operations

### Backend (Node.js)
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login endpoint
- [ ] POST /api/auth/register endpoint
- [ ] POST /api/auth/logout endpoint
- [ ] POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Email verification system

### Integration
- [ ] JWT token storage in localStorage
- [ ] Automatic token refresh mechanism
- [ ] API request interceptor for auth headers
- [ ] Error handling for expired tokens

## 📊 Dependencies
- **Blocked by**: US-005 (Database setup)
- **Blocks**: US-007 (Dashboard layout), US-008 (User profile)
- **Related to**: US-009 (Password reset), US-010 (Session management)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- [ ] Login component tests
- [ ] Registration component tests
- [ ] Auth service tests
- [ ] JWT utility tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Login API endpoint tests
- [ ] Registration API endpoint tests
- [ ] Database user creation tests
- [ ] Token validation tests

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete login workflow
- [ ] Registration workflow
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Session timeout handling

## 📚 Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API documentation for auth endpoints
- [ ] User guide for login/registration
- [ ] Security documentation
- [ ] Memory bank entry for auth patterns

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations
- [ ] Clean, modern login form design
- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## 🔒 Security & Performance
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- [ ] JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation

## 📈 Success Metrics
- [ ] Login success rate > 99%
- [ ] Registration completion rate > 95%
- [ ] Average login time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in auth flow

## 🚀 Deployment Notes
- [ ] JWT_SECRET environment variable configured
- [ ] Database user table migration ready
- [ ] Email service configuration for password reset
- [ ] Monitoring for failed login attempts

## 📝 Notes & Comments
- Consider implementing 2FA in future sprint
- Use OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) for easier onboarding
- Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Store user sessions in Redis for scalability
